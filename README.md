# Marketing-Emotion-Response

## Introduction

This project aims to classify the emotion/reaction on a person's face when viewing adertising media into one of **seven categories**, using deep convolutional neural networks. 
Building from the implementation by [atulapra](https://github.com/atulapra/Emotion-detection) which is based on [this](https://github.com/atulapra/Emotion-detection/blob/master/ResearchPaper.pdf) research paper, the model is trained on the **FER-2013** dataset which was published on International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). This dataset consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with **seven emotions** - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised.

## Dependencies

* Python 3, [OpenCV 3 or 4](https://opencv.org/), [Tensorflow 1 or 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* To install the required packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

The repository is currently compatible with `tensorflow-2.0` and makes use of the Keras API using the `tensorflow.keras` library.

* Download the FER-2013 dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X60B-uR3NtqPd4oosdotpbDgy8KOfUdr/view?usp=sharing) and unzip it inside the `Tensorflow` folder. This will create the folder `data`.

* To train this model or train after making changes to the model, use `python emotions.py --mode train`.

* Download pre-trained model `(model.h5)` from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FUn0XNOzf-nQV7QjbBPA6-8GLoHNNgv-/view?usp=sharing) and then run `python emotions.py --mode display`.

* The folder structure is of the form:  
  Tensorflow:
  * data (folder)
  * `emotions.py` (file)
  * `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` (file)
  * `model.h5` (file)

* This implementation by default detects emotions on all faces in the webcam feed.

* With a simple 4-layer CNN, the test accuracy peaked at around 50 epochs at an accuracy of 63.2%.

## Algorithm

* First, we use **haar cascade** to detect faces in each frame of the webcam feed.

* The region of image containing the face is resized to **48x48** and is passed as input to the ConvNet.

* The network outputs a list of **softmax scores** for the seven classes.

* The emotion with maximum score is displayed on the screen.
